# HealthApp Data
## Author: Rebecca Weiss


Data mining project to run analyses and visualize data from the Apple Health app


*Notes: folder called 'apple_health_export' where all data is, but is massive so in .gitignore

Data explored first is the activity summary, but also could do general health (steps, HR, HRV), and workout data

## import_clean
imports XML data, converts to dictionary, cleans columns/data types
