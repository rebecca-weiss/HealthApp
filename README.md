# HealthApp Data
## Author: Rebecca Weiss


Data mining project to run analyses and visualize data from the Apple Health app from 1/1/2016 - 4/1/2022


*Notes: folder called 'apple_health_export' where all data is, but is massive so in .gitignore

Data explored first is the activity summary and workout data, but also could do general health (steps, HR, HRV) found in "all_records.csv"

## import_clean
imports XML data, converts to dictionary, cleans columns/data types
workouts and activity summary data done so far, saved data/workouts.csv and data/activitysummary.csv
